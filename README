Objective to fork this branch:
=============================
To understand basic Linux kernel build on RPi3 with steps given in below link:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md

Also, need to include sample kernel module and modify existing I2C based Touch 
driver(FT6x06) for future reference.

Block Diagram:
=============

Build Steps:
------------
(Its recommonded to follow steps given in kernel build for rpi above)

##With Raspian on RPi3, First install Git and the build dependencies:
sudo apt-get install git bc bison flex libssl-dev

##Fetch source with below command:
git clone --depth=1 --branch rpi-4.18.y https://github.com/abhinema/linux.git

##Set Build Configuration:
cd linux
KERNEL=kernel7
make bcm2709_defconfig

##Build and install the kernel, modules, and Device Tree blobs:
make -j4 zImage modules dtbs
sudo make modules_install
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
